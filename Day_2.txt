Day 2: Concept Evolution & Visual Prototyping
February 22, 2026

Activities:
Brand Evolution: Rebranded the project from LancerChain to ChainLancer. The new name better reflects the core mission of linking talent through autonomous blockchain infrastructure.
Feature Engineering: Expanded the project scope from a simple escrow service to an AI-Autonomous Agency. This includes features like:
AI Auto-Assemble Team: One prompt to hire a full squad (Dev, QA, Auditor).
Dynamic Milestone Pricing: Automated bonuses for early delivery and penalties for delays.
Security First: Integrated the concept of "Audited Smart Contract Templates" to prevent AI-generated vulnerabilities.
High-Fidelity Prototyping: Executed UI/UX design using v0.dev. Generated a professional Dark-Mode dashboard featuring:
AI Command Center (Natural Language Interface).
Active Escrow Trackers with Avalanche-verified badges.
Team management overview for complex projects.
Pitch Preparation: Drafted the "Master Doc" for the Stage 1 submission and structured the 2-minute pitch video.

Key Takeaways:
The "Spicy" factor (AI Team Assembly) is our winning edge for the Avalanche Build Games.
Moving from "What to build" to "How it looks"—visualizing the product made the technical complexity feel achievable.
ChainLancer isn't just a tool; it's a new paradigm for the future of work
